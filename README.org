This is a simple binary arithmetic expression evaluator implemented
via a generalization of Shunting Yard algorithm to abstract syntax trees.
This program is implemented *using only C*.\\

Floating point and integer arithmetic is supported, the parser will infer
what is necessary from the token stream--in order for an operation to be
performed via floating point arithmetic, you must include a decimal point.\\

The main entry point includes a small ncurses frontend.
